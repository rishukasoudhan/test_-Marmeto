# Product Details Page Readme

## Overview

This document outlines the steps to create an interactive and visually appealing product details page using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The product details page will include sections for showcasing the product, selecting size and color, and a buy button for a seamless shopping experience.

## HTML Structure

The HTML structure consists of a basic layout with a product container divided into two main sections: product image and product information. The product information section includes the product name, description, size selection dropdown, color selection dropdown, and a buy button. Customize the product details accordingly within the designated sections.

## CSS Styling

The CSS file (styles.css) provides styling to enhance the visual presentation of the product details page. It includes styling for the overall body, the product container, and specific styling for elements such as size and color selection dropdowns, and the buy button. Feel free to modify the styles to match your product branding and design preferences.

## JavaScript Functionality

he JavaScript file (script.js) contains a basic function that can be customized to handle Scroll and hover effect and  the purchase logic . 

## Getting Started
